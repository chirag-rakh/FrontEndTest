        <h1>The Pomodoro Technique</h1>
        <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method that involves breaking down work into intervals, typically 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are called "pomodoros", and the technique is named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Francesco Cirillo used as a university student in the late 1980s to track his study time.

        The Pomodoro Technique can help increase productivity by reducing distractions and providing structure to your work day. The short breaks after each pomodoro help to keep your mind refreshed and focused, allowing you to work more efficiently and effectively.

            Additionally, using the Pomodoro Technique can help combat procrastination and overcome writer's block by breaking tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. It also helps you track your progress and see how much work you've accomplished over time.
